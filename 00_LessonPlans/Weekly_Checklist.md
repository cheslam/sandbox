- [ ] Break new coding tasks into small English steps before writing code.
- [ ] Run and test scripts incrementally in the **terminal** and/or **Interactive Window**.
- [ ] Add comments/docstrings as you go (teach future-you whatâ€™s happening).

## ðŸ”¹ GitHub Workflow (Version Control)
- [ ] Stage changes: `git add .`
