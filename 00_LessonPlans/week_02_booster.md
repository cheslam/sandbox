# Week 02 â€“ Mid-Week Booster (1 Hour)

This session keeps your skills sharp between the weekend blocks.  
Target: ~1 hour of practice.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Drills (15 min)
- Create a new file: `02_Code/Week_02/drills.py`.
- Implement short, focused functions:
  - `sum_list(numbers: list[int]) -> int`
  - `reverse_string(s: str) -> str`
  - `count_vowels(s: str) -> int`
- Run them in the Python REPL to confirm they work.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Refactor Practice (15 min)
- Open your Week 1 code and pick one function.
- Improve variable names, add docstrings, and simplify logic where possible.
- Re-run your tests to make sure it still works.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Git Practice (15 min)
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b week2-booster`.
- Add your `drills.py` and commit it.
- Practice staging changes (`git add -p`) and writing clear commit messages.
- Merge your branch back into `main`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Markdown & Notes (15 min)
- Open your learning notes file: `notes/week02.md`.
- Add:
  - Three new commands or concepts you learned this week.
  - A quick explanation in your own words.
  - An example snippet of code fenced in triple backticks.

---

## âœ… Wrap-Up
- Push your changes to GitHub (`git push origin main`).
- Close out by reviewing what felt easy vs. what felt rough.  
- Mark down one question to bring to the weekend block.
