# Week 02: Variables, Functions, Loops

## Goals
- Learn variables, data types, lists
- Write functions
- Practice loops & conditionals
- Push a small interactive script to GitHub

## Steps
1. In `01_Code/Week_02/`, create `age100.py`  

2. Script tasks:  
   - Ask user for their name & age (`input()`)  
   - Print a message: “Hi [name], you will turn 100 in the year ____.”  

3. Add extras:  
   - Store name and age as variables  
   - Use a function to calculate year of turning 100  
   - Use an `if` statement: if age < 0 or > 120, print error message  

4. Commit & push to GitHub repo  

## Deliverable
- `age100.py` in GitHub with working function
