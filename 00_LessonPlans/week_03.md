# Week 03: Files & Errors

## Goals
- Learn to read/write files
- Handle errors with try/except
- Build a word counter script

## Steps
1. In `01_Code/Week_03/`, create `word_counter.py`  

2. Script tasks:  
   - Open a `.txt` file (make a sample text file first)  
   - Count word frequencies  
   - Print the 10 most common words  

3. Add error handling:  
   - If file not found, print “File does not exist.”  

4. Push to GitHub with sample text file and results  

## Deliverable
- `word_counter.py` + sample `.txt` in GitHub
