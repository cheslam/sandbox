# Wins and Frustrations

---

## Week 1
**Wins**
- Correctly installed python, git, and VS code
- Figured out some file naming/location headaches
- Figured out how to use git and github
- Learned markdown syntax

**Frustrations**
- Accidentally ran 'git init' in '~\01_Code\week_01' which caused git to not recognize my 'hello.py' file when trying to add it to my git branch
- Git is a whole new language/method that I need to learn
- Organization of information and tasks was a bit hectic

--- 
## Week 2
**Wins**
- Learned how to use the `input()` function

**Frustrations**
- Skipped a week and so it was hard getting back into the confusing world of git
- `Try:` and `Except:` make less sense to me than `if: else:`
