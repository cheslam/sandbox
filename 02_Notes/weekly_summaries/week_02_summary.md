# Week 2 Wrap-Up Summary  

## ‚úÖ Core Accomplishments  
- Wrote my first **interactive script** (`age100.py`) that asks for input and produces a result.  
- Practiced **input validation** with `try/except` and type checks (`int()`, `ValueError`).  
- Added extra logic to enforce conditions (e.g., **age must be greater than 0**).  
- Learned how to attach **docstrings** to functions for documentation and testing.  
- Created and previewed **Markdown files** directly in VS Code.  
- Continued practicing **Git basics**: staging, committing, and adding all modified files at once (`git add -A`).  
- Documented new insights in `wins_and_frustrations.md` and pushed updates to GitHub.

## üß† Key Concepts Learned  
- **try/except** = handles errors gracefully (e.g., catching `ValueError` when input can‚Äôt convert to `int`).   
- **Docstring** = the first string inside a function, used for help text and documentation (`help(func)` shows it).  
- **Staging area** = a middle layer between working directory and commits; snapshot of changes to be committed.  
- **git add -A** = stage *all* changes (new, modified, deleted) at once.  
- **Markdown preview in VS Code** = `Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Cmd+Shift+V` for rendered view.

## üí° Why This Matters  
- Interactive scripts move me beyond ‚Äúprint-only‚Äù programs and into **real user input/output**.  
- Error handling means my code won‚Äôt crash on bad input, which is a minimum standard for usable software.  
- Docstrings and Markdown help me write **self-explanatory, shareable code and notes**.  
- I now understand more **Git staging vs committing**, which prevents accidental omissions or messy commits.  
- I‚Äôm building muscle memory with Git commands and VS Code shortcuts, keeping friction low.

## üöÄ Next Steps (Week 3)  
- Expand interactive scripts with **loops** and conditional branching.  
- Explore **lists and dictionaries** as data structures.  
- Continue regular commits with descriptive messages.  
- Practice using **branches** again, but for a meaningful feature addition this time.  
- Keep updating notes and weekly wrap-ups to reinforce learning.

# Booster Session
- Strengthened `input()` skills
- Practiced defining functions
- I learned that you can iterate over an object without using `range(len())`
- I also learned that you can natively index characters in a string!
