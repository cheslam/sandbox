# Week 1 Wrap-Up Summary

## âœ… Core Accomplishments
- Installed and configured **Python, Git, VS Code** (development toolkit).
- Created my **first repo** (`sandbox`) and linked it to GitHub.
- Wrote and ran my **first script** (`hello.py`) successfully.
- Learned how to use `.gitignore` to keep junk out of version control.
- Added a **README.md** at the root to document repo contents.
- Created a **notes system** (`wins_and_frustrations.md`) to track progress.
- Practiced **branching and merging** safely with a trivial code change.
- Pushed all progress to GitHub â€” repo is now live.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned
- **Commit** = a local save point (snapshot of changes).
- **Push** = upload commits to GitHub.
- **Branch** = a parallel timeline for experimenting or developing features.
- **Merge** = combining a branchâ€™s changes back into another branch (e.g., `dev` â†’ `main`).
- **README.md** = my repoâ€™s landing page/documentation (auto-rendered on GitHub).
- **.gitignore** = tells Git which files/folders to ignore (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`).
- **Environment** = a self-contained space with Python + packages.
- **pip** = Pythonâ€™s package installer, installs libraries into the active environment.
- **Kernel** = the running process that executes your Python code in an interactive session.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters
- I now understand the **Git/GitHub workflow**: edit â†’ add â†’ commit â†’ push.
- Iâ€™ve seen why branching exists: keep `main` clean while experimenting elsewhere.
- Iâ€™ve set up repo hygiene (README + .gitignore) like a professional developer.
- I know what environments and kernels are, so future projects wonâ€™t blindside me.
- Iâ€™ve built accountability habits (notes, weekly wrap-ups).

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Week 2)
- Write my first **interactive script** (`age100.py`).
- Add input handling and error checking.
- Continue practicing Git commits (one per logical change).
- Push updates to GitHub and reflect in notes.
