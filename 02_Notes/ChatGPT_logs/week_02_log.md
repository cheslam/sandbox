**User:**

I'm starting my week 2 session. How do I preview a markdown file again?

---

**Assistant:**

So you‚Äôve already forgotten how to look at plain text with fancy formatting, huh? Welcome to the glamorous world of Markdown.

How you preview depends on what you‚Äôre using:

VS Code: open your .md file, then either

Hit Ctrl+Shift+V (or Cmd+Shift+V on Mac) to open the preview in a new tab,

Or Ctrl+K V to split the editor and preview side-by-side.

Jupyter/Notebooks: you don‚Äôt ‚Äúpreview‚Äù per se; Markdown renders automatically in text cells when you run them.

Plain GitHub/GitLab/etc.: just click the file in the repo and they render it for you.

Terminal purist masochist style: you can install grip or glow to render Markdown in your terminal, because why not add extra tools to your life?

Which environment are you working in‚ÄîVS Code again, or something else?

---

**User:**

Whats wrong with this?
try:
    isinstance(age, int) == True
except:
    print("Please enter age as a whole number")

---

**Assistant:**

You‚Äôre trying to use a try/except to catch‚Ä¶ a boolean being False. That‚Äôs not an exception, it‚Äôs just disappointing.

Problems:

isinstance(age, int) == True does nothing. You‚Äôre not using the result.

try/except only runs the except if an exception is raised. isinstance won‚Äôt raise one.

except: bare catches everything (including typos), which is sloppy.

Do this instead, depending on where age comes from:

If age is already a variable
python
Copy code
if not isinstance(age, int):
    print("Please enter age as a whole number")

If age comes from user input (string ‚Üí int)
python
Copy code
raw = input("Age: ")
try:
    age = int(raw)           # This is the only part that can sensibly fail
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter age as a whole number")
else:
    # optional extra validations
    if age < 0:
        print("Age cannot be negative")

If you want to be strict and raise an error
python
Copy code
def set_age(age):
    if not isinstance(age, int):
        raise TypeError("age must be an int")
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("age cannot be negative")
    return age


Summary: don‚Äôt compare to == True, don‚Äôt wrap non-failing code in try/except, and only catch the specific exception you expect (ValueError from int() conversion).

---

**User:**

how would I use try/except to check greater than 0?

---

**Assistant:**

You don‚Äôt. A comparison like if age > 0: doesn‚Äôt throw an exception‚Äîit just returns True or False. A try/except block is only useful when something can actually raise (like int("bananas")).

If you want to validate ‚Äúgreater than 0‚Äù safely when parsing user input, you combine both:

python
Copy code
raw = input("Age: ")
try:
    age = int(raw)                 # can raise ValueError
    if age <= 0:                   # comparison never raises
        raise ValueError("Age must be greater than 0")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid input: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Your age is {age}")


Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

int(raw) can fail ‚Üí exception caught.

if age <= 0: raise ValueError(...) is you manually raising the error if the comparison fails.

That way, your except block still handles ‚Äúnot a number‚Äù and ‚Äúnot > 0‚Äù with the same safety net.

So if you really want try/except involved, you must explicitly raise when a value doesn‚Äôt meet your rule.

Do you want me to show you a compact version where the check and error message are all bundled into one neat function?

---

**User:**

How do I add a docstring to a function?

---

**Assistant:**

Put a string literal right under the def line. That‚Äôs it. Python treats the first string in a function body as the docstring.

python
Copy code
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b


Multi-line version with the usual sections:

python
Copy code
def parse_age(raw: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert a string to a positive integer age.

    Args:
        raw: User-provided text, e.g. "27".

    Returns:
        The age as an int.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the string isn't an integer or age <= 0.
    """
    age = int(raw)
    if age <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Age must be greater than 0")
    return age


Useful bits you‚Äôll forget in ten minutes:

Use triple quotes """...""". First line is a short summary; keep it under ~72 chars.

Leave a blank line after the summary if you‚Äôre writing more detail.

You can access it with help(parse_age) or parse_age.__doc__.

Works for modules and classes too: put a string at the top of the file or under class MyThing:.

Pick a style (Google, NumPy, reST) and be consistent. Linters like pydocstyle will nag you into good habits.

If you need quick doctests inside the docstring:

python
Copy code
def double(x: int) -> int:
    """
    Double x.

    >>> double(3)
    6
    """
    return 2 * x


Run python -m doctest -v your_file.py to check those examples. Happy documenting your gloriously obvious functions.

**User:**

how do I add all files with changes to git?

---

**Assistant:**

If you‚Äôve changed a bunch of files and want them all staged in one go, here‚Äôs the menu:

git add -A
Stages everything: new files, modified files, and deletions anywhere in the repo.

git add .
Stages new and modified files in the current directory (and below), but not deletions outside it. Fine if you‚Äôre at repo root, slightly chaotic elsewhere.

git add -u
Stages modified and deleted files, but not new untracked files.

Fast, sensible default from repo root:

bash
Copy code
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe what you actually did"


Helpful extras you‚Äôll wish you used sooner:

See what will be staged: git status

Unstage if you got overexcited: git restore --staged .

Stage just parts of files like a responsible adult: git add -p

Respect .gitignore if something keeps sneaking in there

If git complains, it‚Äôs usually because you‚Äôre not in the repo root, or you‚Äôve helpfully ignored the file you‚Äôre trying to add.

---

**User:**

remind me how the staging works

---

**Assistant:**

Git staging is basically the world‚Äôs most annoying clipboard. You‚Äôve got three layers:

Working directory
Where your files live. You edit stuff here, spill coffee on your laptop, whatever.

Staging area (aka the index)
A middleman. You say ‚Äúyes Git, this exact version of these files, please remember them for the next commit.‚Äù

git add file.py ‚Üí moves the current snapshot of that file into staging.

Change the file again? That new change isn‚Äôt staged until you git add again.

Repository (committed history)
Where your commits go. git commit bundles up everything in the staging area and stores it forever (until you rewrite history and make your coworkers cry).

So the flow is:

bash
Copy code
# You edit something
nano code.py

# Git sees it changed
git status

# You stage that change
git add code.py

# You confirm it‚Äôs staged
git status

# You actually commit it
git commit -m "Fix bug, introduce two new ones"


Key gotchas:

Staging is a snapshot. It‚Äôs not a magical ‚Äúwatch this file forever.‚Äù You can stage part of a file, then keep editing, and the commit won‚Äôt include those later edits.

You can unstage. git restore --staged file.py if you got overeager.

Commit only moves staged stuff. If you forgot to add, it won‚Äôt show up in the commit no matter how many times you squint at the log.

It‚Äôs Git‚Äôs way of making sure you actually think before immortalizing your code crimes.

Want me to show you what staging looks like in practice with a git status before/after example?

**User:**

Can you write a week 2 summary for me? This is the week 1 summary for reference:# Week 1 Wrap-Up Summary

## ‚úÖ Core Accomplishments
- Installed and configured **Python, Git, VS Code** (development toolkit).
- Created my **first repo** (sandbox) and linked it to GitHub.
- Wrote and ran my **first script** (hello.py) successfully.
- Learned how to use .gitignore to keep junk out of version control.
- Added a **README.md** at the root to document repo contents.
- Created a **notes system** (wins_and_frustrations.md) to track progress.
- Practiced **branching and merging** safely with a trivial code change.
- Pushed all progress to GitHub ‚Äî repo is now live.

---

## üß† Key Concepts Learned
- **Commit** = a local save point (snapshot of changes).
- **Push** = upload commits to GitHub.
- **Branch** = a parallel timeline for experimenting or developing features.
- **Merge** = combining a branch‚Äôs changes back into another branch (e.g., dev ‚Üí main).
- **README.md** = my repo‚Äôs landing page/documentation (auto-rendered on GitHub).
- **.gitignore** = tells Git which files/folders to ignore (e.g., __pycache__/, .venv/).
- **Environment** = a self-contained space with Python + packages.
- **pip** = Python‚Äôs package installer, installs libraries into the active environment.
- **Kernel** = the running process that executes your Python code in an interactive session.

---

## üí° Why This Matters
- I now understand the **Git/GitHub workflow**: edit ‚Üí add ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push.
- I‚Äôve seen why branching exists: keep main clean while experimenting elsewhere.
- I‚Äôve set up repo hygiene (README + .gitignore) like a professional developer.
- I know what environments and kernels are, so future projects won‚Äôt blindside me.
- I‚Äôve built accountability habits (notes, weekly wrap-ups).

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Week 2)
- Write my first **interactive script** (age100.py).
- Add input handling and error checking.
- Continue practicing Git commits (one per logical change).
- Push updates to GitHub and reflect in notes.

---

---

**Assistant:**

Here‚Äôs a Week 2 summary in the same structure as your Week 1 write-up:

Week 2 Wrap-Up Summary
‚úÖ Core Accomplishments

Wrote my first interactive script (age100.py) that asks for input and produces a result.

Practiced input validation with try/except and type checks (int(), ValueError).

Added extra logic to enforce conditions (e.g., age must be greater than 0).

Learned how to attach docstrings to functions for documentation and testing.

Created and previewed Markdown files directly in VS Code.

Continued practicing Git basics: staging, committing, and adding all modified files at once (git add -A).

Documented new insights in wins_and_frustrations.md and pushed updates to GitHub.

üß† Key Concepts Learned

try/except = handles errors gracefully (e.g., catching ValueError when input can‚Äôt convert to int).

raise = manually trigger an exception when conditions fail (if age <= 0: raise ValueError).

Docstring = the first string inside a function, used for help text and documentation (help(func) shows it).

Staging area = a middle layer between working directory and commits; snapshot of changes to be committed.

git add -A = stage all changes (new, modified, deleted) at once.

Markdown preview in VS Code = Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V for rendered view.

üí° Why This Matters

Interactive scripts move me beyond ‚Äúprint-only‚Äù programs and into real user input/output.

Error handling means my code won‚Äôt crash on bad input, which is a minimum standard for usable software.

Docstrings and Markdown help me write self-explanatory, shareable code and notes.

I now fully understand Git staging vs committing, which prevents accidental omissions or messy commits.

I‚Äôm building muscle memory with Git commands and VS Code shortcuts, keeping friction low.

üöÄ Next Steps (Week 3)

Expand interactive scripts with loops and conditional branching.

Explore lists and dictionaries as data structures.

Continue regular commits with descriptive messages.

Practice using branches again, but for a meaningful feature addition this time.

Keep updating notes and weekly wrap-ups to reinforce learning.

Do you want me to also draft a short ‚ÄúWeek 2 Wins & Frustrations‚Äù entry for your wins_and_frustrations.md so it stays aligned with this summary?

**User:**
